# NEW YORK BAGELS

*Makes 6 large bagels*.  Feel free to portion these smaller if you want smaller bagels.

## INGREDIENTS

- 22 oz high gluten flour
- 12.7 oz water
- 1 tsp. instant dry yeast
- 0.5 oz salt
- 0.5 oz diastatic malt powder

## NOTES 
Use the exact ingredients listed. Do not use bread flour as a replacement for high-gluten. Do not use non-diastatic malt powder. You can use active dry yeast as a substitute but you need to dissolve it in a bit of the water before adding it to the rest of the ingredients.

I use a commercial mixer but you can use a home model Kitchen Aid or similar stand mixer. Be careful that you don't overload your mixer if you double or triple the recipe. Bagel dough is tough on mixers and is the reason I have made this recipe small.

If any of the steps are confusing or you don't understand any of the terms, use your favorite Internet search engine to learn more. Do not expect to get these perfect on the first attempt. I have made literally thousands of bagels in my lifetime, both professionally and at home. If you hope to make them look as good as mine on the first attempt, you are fooling yourself. Just like learning any skill, it takes time.

## INSTRUCTIONS

Combine the flour, instant dry yeast, and malt powder in a large mixing bowl. Add the water and salt. Mix on the lowest speed using the dough hook, or with a wooden spoon if by hand, until all the dry ingredients are moistened and of a somewhat uniform consistency, about 4 minutes in a stand mixer.

Increase the speed to 2 on a mixer or dump out on a clean smooth work surface if mixing by hand. Mix for another 5 - 6 minutes in a mixer or knead for about 7 - 8 minutes by hand.

Bagel dough should be smooth, elastic and extensible when fully mixed.

Turn onto a clean dry surface and cut with a dough knife or regular kitchen knife into 5 oz pieces. One piece at a time, push the dough piece into an irregular rectangle that is about 3 - 4 inches long. Position the longer edge parallel to the edge of the table nearest you. Fold starting from the side furthest from your edge of the table, to the middle and then again in half so that, in the end, you have a cylinder. Do not try to work it or shape it any more, just lightly form the cylinder and let rest, covered with a sheet of plastic, seam side down, for about 10 minutes.

Now, to shape the bagels, roll each cylinder into a rope about 6 - 8 inches long. Wrap the rope around 4 fingers and overlapping back on itself to form a bagel shape. With the bagel still wrapper around your hand, form the overlapping sides together by moving your hand back and forth on the table while pressing down lightly on the dough. See shaping method #2 on [this page](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2020/01/15/how-to-shape-bagels). Place bagels, seam side down on lightly oiled boards dusted with cornmeal or semolina flour. You can use a cookie sheet for this. Spray the top of the bagels lightly with pan spray and cover tightly with plastic. Place in your refrigerator for 8 hours or overnight (up to 16 hours).

Before removing from refrigeration, heat your oven to 475 degrees and bring a large pot of water (at least 4 inches deep) to a boil. Once the water is boiling and the oven is hot, add a tablespoon or two of honey to the water. Remove the bagels from refrigeration andboil in batch of 3 to 4 bagels per batch. The bagels should sink when you first place them in the water. Give them a light stir to make sure they don't stick to each other or to the bottom of the pot. Once the bagel start to rise to the surface, boil for an additional 15 seconds per side. Remove the bagels one at a time with a slotted spoon, placing them right side up back on the board or pan they were on. Top as desired while they are still wet and place them on a parchment-lined sheet pan and, once they are all on the parchment, bake for 18-20 minutes until nicely browned. Some toppings may burn before your bagels are fully done, so take care. If the toppings are burning, you can reduce the heat in the oven during the last 5 minutes and the bagels will continue to cook from the residual heat.
